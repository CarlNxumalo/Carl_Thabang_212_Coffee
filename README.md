# Carl_Thabang_212_Coffee CMPG212 Module

The purpose of this assessment is to test how well you are able to integrate the concepts that you
have learned in SU1 and SU2 into a basic Windows Application. 

Create an app that can help Beelte-Cafe!
The coffee shop wants to ensure they maintain high client satisfaction. It is for this reason that the
shop decided to digitalize its ordering and bookkeeping. In this regard, the shop approached you
with the following specifications:

• The application should initiate with a professional welcome screen.
• Clients should be able to easily order a variety of coffee, tea, pastries, and sandwiches. (hint,
clients do not like a bunch of pop-up screens – MDIs might help get around this).
• Clients should also be able to review their selection and remove an item from their list
before they submit their order.
• Once the clients submitted their order, they should be presented with a receipt screen – all
orders should be captured in a separate table.
• For bookkeeping purposes, BeelteCaf prefers having a separate table for all the drinks and
food. The application should allow staff to log into the system/application where they can
see accounting information such as how many of what was sold, at what time, best-selling
items, profit, etc.
• Staff members should be allowed to update the database when an item is sold out, when
there are new specials, when a new coffee is introduced, and when an item is no longer
being served.
• Staff said they would also like to have the flexibility to generate custom reports and filter the
database.
